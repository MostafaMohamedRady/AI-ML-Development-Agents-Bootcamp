SmartCafe Assistant
===================
Object-Oriented Programming in Python - Team Project - SmartCafe Assistant OOP Based Console Application


Overview
--------
SmartCafe Assistant is a Python-based console chatbot for SmartCafe.
It answers common user questions about drinks, ingredients, nutrition, and opening hours using local data from `cafe_data.json`.

How it Works
------------
The system uses two classes:
- `ChatBotAgent`:
        Handles user input
        analysis question patterns
        delegates queries.
- `ResearchAgent`:
        load the data from the file.
        get_ingredients
        get_nutritional_info
        get_working_hours
        get_available_drinks

Regex Intent Recognition
------------------------
Regex is used to detect the user's question intent:

1. **Ingredients**: Matches "What’s in a (drink)?"  
   → Extracts drink name and returns ingredient list.

2. **Nutrition**: Matches "How many calories in (drink)?"  
   → Returns calorie and sugar content.

3. **Hours**: Matches "When are you open on (day)?"  
   → Returns opening time for the specified day.

4. **Available Drinks**: Matches "What drinks do you have?"  
   → Lists all drinks in `cafe_data.json`.
